### How we build this Game:   
This Game has sevral **Scenes** while the first one is the **Main Nenu** Scene which you'll see in the begining of the game,

Every Lvele Scene has the following objects:

### Bricks   
There are two kinds of bricks; **"Brick"** and **HarderBrick"**.    
Each one is a **prefab** and while both have a Poligon Coillider and Sprite Rendere they each have their own Script.
Brick has its own BrickScript and HarderBrick has its own HarderBrickScript.
